# Chinese Tenses and Time

## Time in Chinese

Unlike English, Chinese verbs don't change form to show tense. Instead, time is expressed through:
- Time words
- Context
- Particles

## Present Tense

The basic form of the verb is used for present tense:
- 我学习中文 (Wǒ xuéxí zhōngwén)
- I study Chinese

## Past Tense

### Using 了 (le)
Add 了 after the verb to indicate completed action:
- 我吃了饭 (Wǒ chīle fàn)
- I ate

### Using 过 (guo)
Add 过 to indicate past experience:
- 我去过中国 (Wǒ qùguo zhōngguó)
- I have been to China

## Future Tense

### Using 要 (yào)
- 我要去北京 (Wǒ yào qù běijīng)
- I am going to Beijing

### Using 会 (huì)
- 明天会下雨 (Míngtiān huì xiàyǔ)
- It will rain tomorrow
